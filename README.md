# Abstract

## Background

Decisions about when to change antidepressant treatment are complex and benefit
from accurate prediction of treatment outcome. Prognostic accuracy can be
enhanced by incorporating repeated assessments of symptom severity collected
during treatment.

## Methods

Participants (n=714) from the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression
study received escitalopram or nortriptyline over 12 weeks. Remission was
defined as scoring ≤7 on the Hamilton Rating Scale. Predictors included
demographic, clinical, and genetic variables (at 0 weeks) and measures of
symptom severity (at 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks). Longitudinal descriptors extracted
with growth curves and topological data analysis were used to inform prediction
of remission.

## Results

Repeated assessments produced gradual and drug-specific improvements in
predictive performance. By week four, models’ discrimination in all samples
reached levels that might usefully inform treatment decisions (AUC=0.777 for
nortriptyline; AUC=0.807 for escitalopram; AUC=0.794 for combined sample).

## Conclusions

Decisions around switching or modifying treatments for depression can be
informed by repeated symptoms assessments collected during treatment, but not
until four weeks after the start of treatment.
